 
## Removed From Play Store

Since Google has a zero tolerance and zero appeal process for removing apps, booru apps are always at high risk of takedown from the Play Store. Some of the best ones have been banned, and are usually no longer supported.

* Konachan Anime Wallpapers - Multiple booru, and multiple Tag support.
* [Anime boxes](http://forum.animebox.es/) - 

## Outdated

* Minoriko 2 - Only supports 2.3, and basically no longer works for Danbooru.
